-> This proposal is an attempt to construct a smart, innovative and secure entry by using the raspberry pi controller, camera and various other    associated sensors.
-> Due to popularity and flexibility of using current social network for all type of generation, we are proposing home security system using Telegram notification.
-> In existing system, notification is through E-mail or Twitter account.
-> Step 1: Database - This contains the faces of person who are authenticated to enter the house
-> Step 2: Start-up of Secure Door – The user can keep the security system ON/OFF depending on whether he is available at home or not. When ‘start’ command is typed on the Telegram then it activates the monitoring system,in return home security system notifies a welcome message as “Welcome to House Notification”
-> Step 3: Object Identification using IR Sensor -IR sensor is activated when it senses any motion near the door and activates the camera. When activated camera clicks the image of the person standing in front of the door for surveillance
-> Step 4: Identification of Person - When image is clicked, face recognition is done against the image stored in the database. For authenticate person door will open and for unauthenticated person it notifies the house owner.
-> Step 5: Door Action – Authenticated person is allowed to enter the house and corresponding detail message about the person is shared with the owner. If any person who is not available in the database and the owner wants him/her to enter in the house then open command is manually given to the Raspberry pi  by the owner of the house to open the door automatically. ‘Open’ command is used to open the door by owner. Raspberry pi  in response to the above command give the message “open door!” to notify the status of the door to the owner.
